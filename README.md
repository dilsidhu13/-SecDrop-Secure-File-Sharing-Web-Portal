# SecDrop-Secure-File-Sharing-Web-Portal
# Problem Definition
SecDrop is a secure, web-based file sharing platform designed specifically for
individuals or teams needing simple, encrypted file exchange. The system supports two
user roles: Admin Users and General Users, each with distinct access levels.
Admin Users manage platform configurations, view system activity, and control file
upload rules. General Users can upload files (even anonymously), generate password-
protected or token-based share links, and share content securely.
The platform’s primary goal is to provide a lightweight, user-friendly interface with AES-
256 encryption, customizable sharing options, and optional QR code generation, ideal
for academic institutions, startups, or small organizations. The motivation behin d this
project is to build a fast, privacy-first tool for securely exchanging files with minimal
setup and access control options.

# User Roles and Functionalities
Admin Users – User Role 1
• Platform Settings Control: Adjust maximum file size, expiration days, and
anonymous upload rules.
• Audit and Logs: View file upload history, access logs, and user activity.
• Privacy Management: Toggle visibility of file listings, manage hidden file access.
General Users – User Role 2
• File Upload & Encryption: Upload files with client-side AES-256 encryption.
• Link Generation: Create password-protected or token-based share links.
• QR Code Sharing: Instantly generate QR codes for token links.
• Anonymous Uploads: Upload files without registration (if enabled by admin).
• Account-Based Management (optional): Registered users can manage past
uploads and generated links
